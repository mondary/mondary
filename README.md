### Hi, I'm Clément — Design Director & UX Strategist

I craft digital products that balance clarity, efficiency, and thoughtful design.  
My work spans UX strategy, product architecture, system thinking, and lightweight engineering approaches.  
I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, well-structured experiences.

🖌️ Projects

PK Suite  
A collection of lightweight web tools built with a minimalist philosophy: fast, dependency-light, and privacy-friendly.  
Each app is designed with clarity, ergonomics, and accessible UI patterns.  
Current modules include PK Notes, PK Cuisto, and PK About — all powered by clean vanilla stacks.

Mondary Design System  
A pragmatic design system tailored for cross-platform products.  
Focused on consistency, ergonomics, and scalability, it bridges UX foundations with adaptable components and patterns.

Flat-File API Experiments  
Exploring alternative backends using JSON, UnQLite, and DuckDB to build small, resilient, serverless-friendly APIs without database overhead.  
Ideal for personal tools, side-projects, and rapid prototyping.

AI-Enhanced Workflow  
Design and development workflows enhanced through custom AI agents, CLI automation, and structured creative pipelines.  
Focused on clarity, reproducibility, and acceleration without sacrificing craft.

Design Leadership & Product Strategy  
Beyond tools, I help teams structure their design processes, improve collaboration between Design × Product × Engineering, and scale UX maturity within organizations.
