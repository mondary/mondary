### Hi, I'm Clément — Design Director & UX Strategist
---
🔭 I craft lean, clear, user-focused digital products.  
🌱 I love vibecoding and building with lightweight stacks (vanilla JS, PHP flat-files, Tailwind, Radix).  
⚙️ My heart swings between Grok, Codex, Qwen-Code, Gemini-CLI, Cursor-CLI, Qoder, KimiK2, and GLM.  
💬 Ask me about UX strategy, design leadership, service design, or design systems.  
⚡ Fun fact: I design, I build, I streamline — always.


🖌️ Projects

PK Suite  
A collection of lightweight web tools built with a minimalist philosophy: fast, dependency-light, and privacy-friendly.  
Each app is designed with clarity, ergonomics, and accessible UI patterns.  
Current modules include PK Notes, PK Cuisto, and PK About — all powered by clean vanilla stacks.
