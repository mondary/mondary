### Hi, I'm Clément — Design Director & UX Strategist

🔭 I’m currently working on creating lean digital products with a strong focus on user experience, system thinking, and design-led strategy.  
🌱 I’m currently learning new ways to simplify tooling and workflows using lightweight stacks (vanilla JS, PHP flat-files, Tailwind, Radix, AI-assisted dev).  
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects where design, tech, and business meet to create meaningful, efficient user experiences.  
💬 Ask me about UX strategy, design leadership, service design, design systems, or how to bring clarity to complex digital environments.  
📫 How to reach me: **mondary.design**  
⚡ Fun fact: I use both sides of my brain equally — I design, I build, and I simplify.
